<h1 style="color: purple;"> AMEER'S BLOG </h1>
<p>My name is Ameer Hussain. I was raised in NYC and moved here to sunny San Diego. I'm taking AP CSP because my late grandma always believed that coding and technology was the future (she had very limited information about computers). She used to tell me that I was special and would be great. She told me that I would grow into my name - Ameer, which means prince & rich. We were very close, and in one ofthe last conversations we had she reminded me to go forth and embrace the future (of technology) and become great like she always believed I would.</p>
